            <article class="about_article">
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello my name is Calvin, a software developer from Junction City,
                    Kansas.
                    For the past thirteen years I have been working as a mechanic, but have decided to
                    switch careers into software development. In my career as a mechanic I grew a high interest
                    in the advancement of technology, and learned that being a developer could not only expand my
                    horizon
                    in the automotive field, it could also increase my diagnostic skills. The more I learned about being
                    a
                    developer the the more my career choices grew and I decided that being a developer would be a better
                    match
                    for me.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The constant diagnosis and repair of problems(fixing bugs) were a quick
                    catch for my interest.
                    Thinking
                    about a problem for
                    hours and looking for information through the internet and other sources, made me to want to keep
                    pursuing a developer
                    career. The evolution of coding languages and trying to keep up with each one is a never ending
                    quest!
                    Being a mechanic has its quirks but,
                    those quirks tend to be monotonous and boring after a while. The way I see it, the new knowledge a
                    person acquires development is like
                    a mechanic buying another tool, because now that you have it you can put it to use!
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a wife and two children that I love to spend time with. In my
                    spare time I prefer to go to the
                    gym
                    and work up a good sweat to release
                    the stress of the day. If I am not spending time with my family or exercising I am helping my
                    parents
                    out with chores around the house or doing
                    mechanic work (a lot of times not my choice!. lol!). Last but not least, if I am not doing
                    <i>ANY</i> of
                    the previous listed (which is rare), I like
                    to watch t.v, play games or just lay in bed and stare up at the ceiling to relax get some sleep.

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <article>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been a developer for a while and created some projects with
                front-end technologies such as HTML,
                CSS, REACT and JavaScript. I have also
                created projects with some back-end technologies such as node. I am currently teaching myself about the
                MERN stack which could also include, my
                small workings with MongoDB, and express. My code editor of choice is visual studio code, and I have
                shared my work with the github community.
                I have also worked with git but prefer to work with the command line.
