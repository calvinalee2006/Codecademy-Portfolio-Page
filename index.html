            <article class="about_article">
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello my name is Calvin, a software developer from Junction City,
                    Kansas.
                    For the past thirteen years I have been working as a mechanic, but have decided to
                    switch careers into software development. In my career as a mechanic I grew a high interest
                    in the advancement of technology, and learned that being a developer could not only expand my
                    horizon
                    in the automotive field, it could also increase my diagnostic skills. The more I learned about being
                    a
                    developer the the more my career choices grew and I decided that being a developer would be a better
                    match
                    for me.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The constant diagnosis and repair of problems(fixing bugs) were a quick
                    catch for my interest.
                    Thinking
                    about a problem for
                    hours and looking for information through the internet and other sources, made me to want to keep
                    pursuing a developer
                    career. The evolution of coding languages and trying to keep up with each one is a never ending
                    quest!
                    Being a mechanic has its quirks but,
                    those quirks tend to be monotonous and boring after a while. The way I see it, the new knowledge a
                    person acquires development is like
                    a mechanic buying another tool, because now that you have it you can put it to use!
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a wife and two children that I love to spend time with. In my
                    spare time I prefer to go to the
                    gym
                    and work up a good sweat to release
                    the stress of the day. If I am not spending time with my family or exercising I am helping my
                    parents
                    out with chores around the house or doing
                    mechanic work (a lot of times not my choice!. lol!). Last but not least, if I am not doing
                    <i>ANY</i> of
                    the previous listed (which is rare), I like
                    to watch t.v, play games or just lay in bed and stare up at the ceiling to relax get some sleep.

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been a developer for a while and created some projects with
                    front-end technologies such as HTML,
                    CSS, REACT and JavaScript. I have also
                    worked with back end technology such as Node. I am currently teaching myself about
                    the
                    MERN stack which will broaden my horizon with MongoDB, and express. My code editor of choice is
                    visual studio code, and I have
                    shared my work with the github community.
                    I have also worked with git but prefer to work with the command line.

                            <p>As a self taught developer, I stared with the three main languages
                                any developer should learn, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Though I went
                                through many rotations of trial and error I was able to make projects
                                that I have become proud of!

                                <p> This was a small project I made while learning to code, called the Tea Cozy Project.
                                    This Project was a fake representation of a tea shop. I mostly used HTML, and CSS
                                    for
                                    this project. As a developer, the hardest part of this project was using CSS
                                    flexbox.
                                    I learned that this was a tricky language when learning to code. Click <a

                                <p>This was a small online to-do list that I made that would focus on the functionality

                                    JavaScript. There is not a lot of HTML and CSS but the goal was to make a to-do list
                                    with
                                    javaScript functions and
                                    event listeners to make the project. I used a lot of outside sources to form and

                                    and
                                    learned that there are other
                                    developers that run into the same issues that i had building this project.Click <a

                                    out as

                                    This was a Rock, Scissors, paper game that made a user battle against a computer.
                                    For me
                                    it
                                    was very
                                    difficult,
                                    trying to get the game to have the correct outcome against a user. But the more I
                                    completed
                                    the more
                                    I became more comfortable using javaScript conditionals to solve my problems. Click

                            <p>After Learning the basic beginner languages, I moved on to learning about the
                                JavaScript
                                library
                                React. This was very difficult for me since it seemed like there was a lot more to
                                learn, I
                                even
                                learned about
                                react having its own site! As I built projects I grew as a developer because of my
                                new
                                knowledge. </p>

                                <p>This project took me a while to stagger and stumble
                                    across as I was learning about
                                    learning abut React, hooks and the over all setup of the React library. This is
                                    just
                                    an
                                    app
                                    to use to help manage spending.
                                    As stated my biggest challenge was learning how to properly use hooks in react
                                    and
                                    learning
                                    how to lift components to app.js. I also used a small amount
                                    of bootstrap. Even using bootstrap I learned my UI skills are lacking but I was
                                    proud of
                                    the
                                    outcome of the functionality. Click <a
