## Summary
This is my portfolio page to become a software developer. A lot of youtube, research and hours went into this project. It may not look like much to the naked eye but I am proud of my simple project. My biggest challenge was using Javascript to make pop-up boxes for the first time. With this I know I am on my way to becoming a developer.
